## About
**CarePackages4U** is a web application that my team and I created during **XDHacks Mini-Covid**, a online hackathon hosted on **June 6th, 2020-June 7th, 2020.** With this project, we were able to obtain **2nd place out of the 21 teams at the competition.**
<br />
<br />
     **CarePackages4U** is an easily accessible web application that allows anyone who is unable to leave their houses to request their needs in a list. Local volunteers, donors, food banks, or charities can then view their list in the homepage, contact them, then set up a plan for delivering the needs for them. Check out our full product description [**here!**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT1LJSLl0Z23vlOB85TWzxkdg2SoNmK6iAD0qhNeztc8oaRX2forELng5JmbBCLlNxqIqWITkGGG1l1/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=15000&slide=id.p) or watch this short [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyt20a6v2qw) showcasing our project!

# About
**CarePackages4U** is a web application that my team and I created during **XDHacks Mini-Covid**, a online hackathon hosted on **June 6th, 2020-June 7th, 2020.** With this project, we were able to obtain **2nd place out of the 32 teams at the compeition.**
<br />
<br />
     **CarePackages4U** is an easily accessible web application that allows anyone who is unable to leave their houses to request their needs in a list. Local volunteers, donors, food banks, or charities can then view their list in the homepage, contact them, then set up a plan for delivering the needs for them.
